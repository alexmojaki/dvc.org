# Share a Project

You can [share a project within a team](#share-a-project-within-a-team). You can
also [make a project public](#make-a-project-public) to share it on the web.

## Share a project within a team

Each team that you [create in Iterative Studio](/doc/studio/user-guide/teams)
will have its own projects dashboard. All the projects that you create in the
team's dashboard will be accessible to all members (collaborators) of the team.

To add more than 2 collaborators in your team, you can
[upgrade it to the **Team** or **Enterprise** plan](/doc/studio/user-guide/change-team-plan-and-size).

## Make a project public

To share a project on the web (i.e., to make the project public), click on the
button labeled `Private` next to the name of the project. In the menu that pops
up, turn on `Share to Web`.

You can change a shared (public) project and make it private by turning off
`Share to web`.

Projects that are shared on the web can be opened by anyone, including people
who are not logged in to Iterative Studio. These anonymous users have the
`Visitor` role. Their access is limited to opening the project, applying
filters, and showing/hiding columns for themselves without making permanent
changes to the project. Refer to the [Roles](/doc/studio/user-guide/teams#roles)
section for details on the features available for different roles.
