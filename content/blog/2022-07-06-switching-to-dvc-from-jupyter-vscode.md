title: Using the DVC VSCode Extension with a Jupyter Notebook

description: >
  Working with notebooks is common in machine learning. That's why we're
  covering some tools that make it easy to do more with a complex project.

  Once you've run some experiments in a Jupyter notebook, you know that you
  can't save each experiment. Now, if you're using the Jupyter VSCode extension,
  we can show you how to make those experiments reproducible with the addition
  of the DVC VSCode extension.

For many machine learning engineers, the starting point of a project is a
Jupyter notebook. This is fine for running a few experiments, but there comes a
point where you need to scale the project to accomodate hundreds or even
thousands more experiments. It will also be important to track the experiments
you run so that when you find an exceptional model, you'll be able to reproduce
it and get it ready for production.

In this tutorial, we're going to run a few experiments in our Juptyer notebook
in VSCode. Then we'll convert it to DVC to make reproducible experiments and use
the DVC VSCode extension to run new experiments and compare them all.
[Here's the project](https://github.com/iterative/stale-model-example/tree/jupyter-to-dvc)
we'll be working with.

## Start training with the notebook

## Integrate with DVC

## Look at metrics from experiments

## Conclusion
